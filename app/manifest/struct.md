## 🧠 **Manifestro.io — Waitlist Landing Page (CI as Core Tech Paradigm)**

### **1. HERO**
**Headline:**  
*Manifestro: The First True CI Platform*

**Sub-headline:**  
*Where Collective Intelligence emerges from specialized intellectrons—Planner, Searcher, Expert, Memory, Orchestrator—working as one cognitive unit. Not just AI agents. A thinking team.*

**Primary CTA:**  
*Join the CI Waitlist*

**Visual:**

### **2. CI PARADIGM EXPLAINED**
**Title:** *Collective Intelligence: The Next Layer of AI*

**Key Message:**  
*CI is not multi-agent systems. It's **cognitive collaboration**—where specialized intellectrons share memory, context, and reasoning paths to form a single emergent intelligence.*

**CI Principles (Bullets):**
- 🧩 **Cognitive Specialization** – Each intellectron has a dedicated thinking role
- 🔄 **Shared Consciousness** – Memory and context are collective
- 🧠 **Emergent Reasoning** – The team reasons as one mind
- ⚡ **Real-time Collaboration** – No handoffs, no latency

### **3. THE CI ARCHITECTURE**
**Title:** *How CI Works in Manifestro*

**Visual:**  
Architecture diagram showing:
- **User Input** → **Orchestrator** → **Specialized Intellectrons** (Planner, Searcher, Expert, Memory) → **Collective Output**

**Explanation:**  
*Your query is processed by a team of intellectrons simultaneously. The Orchestrator coordinates, the Planner structures, the Searcher researches, the Expert analyzes, the Memory retains—all in one cognitive cycle.*

---

### **4. INTELLECTRON ROLES (CI UNITS)**
- 🗓️ **Planner** – Strategic thinking & timeline reasoning
- 🔍 **Searcher** – Information retrieval & synthesis  
- 🎓 **Expert** – Domain-specific deep knowledge
- 🧠 **Memory** – Long-term context & relationship mapping
- 🎛️ **Orchestrator** – Cognitive workflow coordination

*Each intellectron can be powered by any model (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Moonshot, or your own intellectron-0.1).*

---

### **5. CI IN ACTION**
**Example Query:** *"Plan a product launch and analyze market risks"*

**CI Response Flow:**
1. **Orchestrator** decomposes the task
2. **Planner** creates timeline
3. **Searcher** gathers market data
4. **Expert** evaluates risks
5. **Memory** connects to past launches
6. **Collective output** delivered as one coordinated response

---

### **6. WHY CI MATTERS NOW**
**Title:** *Beyond Chatbots, Beyond Agents*

**Message:**  
*Single AI models hit complexity ceilings. Multi-agent systems create coordination overhead. **CI is the third way**—specialized cognitive units working as one mind. This is how AI scales to real business complexity.*
